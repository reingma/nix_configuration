This is my basic configuration for a nixos based system.

Idea is that features can be toggable, based on misterio77 config.

Here is a few things I still want to do:
- Add neotest and debugger for rust.
- Add SOPS for managing my passwords and keys.
- Investigate making initialization more seemless.
- Add a good configuration for wsl.
